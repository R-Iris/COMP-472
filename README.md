# COMP-472
Repository for the Fall 2021 COMP-472 (Artificial Intelligence) course at Concordia University. 

# Assignment 1
Among different libraries, we used **sklearn** the most. We used a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, a Decision Tree Classifier, a Grid Search CV, a Perceptron and MLP Classifier on the same dataset. We used various parameters to compare these classifiers (average accuracy, macro F1, average weighted-average F1, etc.)

# Assignment 2
Created a game similar to tic-tac-toe where a player could play against an AI. The AI could use different algorithms and "homemade" heuristics. AI vs AI was also possible. Various parameteres were used to compare the effectiveness between algorithms and heuristics.

# Assingmnet 3
Created an AI that would find a synonym to the word given using different models (glove-wiki-gigaword-100, glove-twitter-50, word2vec-google-news-300, etc.) Various parameters wre used to compare the effectiveness between the models.
