Not all models have the same performance after having been run many times. The models that have zero standard
deviation for all three averages indicate having no change in the performance after multiple tries.
The following models have zero standard deviation change:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
- Base Decision Tree

Models that have a non-zero standard deviation for any of the three averages indicate a performance change after
multiple tries. The following models have non-zero standard deviation for at least one of the metrics:
- Top Decision tree (using Grid Search CV)
- Perceptron
- Base Multi-Layered Perceptron (standard deviations close to zero)
- Top Multi-Layered Perceptron (using Grid Search CV), (standard deviations close to zero)
